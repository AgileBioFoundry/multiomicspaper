# Multimomics paper repo


We present a set of tools that, combined, provide the ability to store, visualize and leverage multiomics data to predict the outcome of bioengineering efforts. 

We show how to use: 
- [**ICE**](https://github.com/JBEI/ice) to store strain information
- [**OMG**](https://github.com/JBEI/OMG) to generate a mock dataset of omics data  
- [**EDD**](https://github.com/JBEI/EDD) to store experiment data and metadata
- [**ART**](https://github.com/JBEI/ART) to leverage these data to suggest new experiments that improve isoprenol production. 

By combining these tools with **Jupyter notebooks** we show how to pinpoint genetic modifications that improve production of  isoprenol, a potential biofuel, in a simulated data set. We expect the same procedures to be applicable in the case of real experimental data. 


## Requirements

Provided notebooks run on two different Jupyter lab kernels, for which we provide a set of requirements in the `kernel_requirements` directory.
